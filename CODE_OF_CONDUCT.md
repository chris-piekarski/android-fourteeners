# The Summit Code of Conduct

## Our Base Camp Pledge

In the spirit of reaching new heights together, we as members, contributors, and maintainers pledge to make participation in the Android Fourteeners project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of:

- Your preferred IDE (yes, even if you use Vim in 2024)
- Whether you take the standard route or bushwhack your own trail through the codebase
- Your elevation gain experience (sea-level developers welcome!)
- Whether you prefer tabs or spaces (but seriously, it's spaces)
- Your choice of light theme vs dark theme (though dark theme at altitude saves battery)
- Whether you've actually summited a fourteener or just code from your basement

## Our Standards (The Leave No Trace Principles for Code)

### Examples of behavior that creates a positive environment (Good Beta):

* **Sharing the Trail**: Using welcoming and inclusive language
* **Proper Cairns**: Leaving helpful code comments for future developers
* **Summit Register Etiquette**: Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* **Belaying Your Partner**: Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* **Weather Window Wisdom**: Focusing on what is best for not just us as individuals, but for the entire climbing party (community)
* **Showing Empathy**: Understanding that everyone was once struggling with their first `NullPointerException` at 14,000 feet

### Examples of unacceptable behavior (Getting Your Repo Privileges Revoked):

* **Trail Cutting**: The use of sexualized language, imagery, or unwelcome advances (This isn't Tinder, it's GitHub)
* **Altitude Sickness Behavior**: Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* **False Summit Claims**: Public or private harassment
* **Gear Theft**: Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
* **Glissading Through a Wilderness Area**: Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities (Ranger Duties)

Project maintainers are like wilderness rangers - responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior. They have the right and responsibility to:

- Remove, edit, or reject code commits, comments, and other contributions that violate the Code of Conduct
- Issue temporary or permanent bans for behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, or harmful
- Check if you properly cached your dependencies before heading up the mountain
- Ensure nobody's leaving `console.log()` statements at camp (pack it in, pack it out)

## Scope (The Trailhead to Summit)

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples include:

- Using an official project email address
- Posting via official social media accounts
- Acting as an appointed representative at online or offline events
- Wearing your "I deployed to production on Friday" t-shirt

## Enforcement (Search and Rescue)

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team. All complaints will be reviewed faster than you can say "false summit" and will result in a response deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident, just like how we don't reveal who forgot to bring the coffee on the camping trip.

## Enforcement Guidelines (The Yosemite Decimal System for Behavior)

### Class 1 - Verbal Warning
**Behavior**: A single minor offense or first-time violation
**Consequence**: Like getting caught jaywalking across the trail - a friendly reminder of proper etiquette

### Class 2 - Temporary Ban
**Behavior**: A pattern of minor violations or a moderate offense
**Consequence**: Time-out period, like being weathered off the mountain - come back when conditions improve

### Class 3 - Permanent Ban
**Behavior**: Serious violations or continued patterns after warnings
**Consequence**: Your climbing permit has been permanently revoked. Find another mountain.

### Class 4 - Immediate Ban
**Behavior**: Severe violations including harassment, discrimination, or threats
**Consequence**: Helicopter evacuation - immediate removal, no questions asked

### Class 5 - Legal Action
**Behavior**: Illegal activities
**Consequence**: We're calling the actual rangers (law enforcement)

## Attribution (The Topo Map)

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 1.4, with additional mountaineering metaphors that may or may not make sense at sea level.

## Remember

- **Altitude is just a number**: Whether you're coding at sea level or in Leadville, all contributions matter
- **There's no shame in turning back**: If your PR isn't ready, it's okay to close it and try again
- **Solo climbing is dangerous**: Pair programming and code reviews make us all safer
- **Check your ego at the trailhead**: We're all here to learn and improve
- **The best view comes after the hardest climb**: Debugging that nasty bug will be worth it

## Final Thought

Just like on the mountain, we're all roped together. One person's bug becomes everyone's problem, but one person's solution elevates us all. Be kind, be patient, and remember - it's not about conquering the mountain, it's about respecting it.

Happy coding, and may your builds always be green! üèîÔ∏è
